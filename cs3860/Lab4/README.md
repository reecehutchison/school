You'll see the first and seconde parts of the assignments in the haskell
file are separated by comments... The cpp, st and first part of the haskell
file do the reverse concat (chunk). Then in the haskell file i also provided
the loc function which gets the location of the elelment in the list. Then, 
the hill cipher i used my multiplication function from assignment 3, and 
other helpers from there too, to do the hill cipher. I included the 
wiki key and inverse matrices in the haskell script (so you can go and alter
them inside the file if you please). The hill cipher will only work with 
messaged that are divisiable by 3.
