Program 1 : 
    Simulates a game of Craps. 

Program 2 : 
    Simulates Conway's Game of Life.

Make files are included in the project directory.
To build, just enter the directory of the project
you want to run and type "make run", and it will 
build and run the program.

note: to run program 2, you need to have ncurses 
installed. 

To use the programs, just follow the instructions
during after running the programs. For Program 1, 
just click enter pretty much to roll the dice, and 
then when prompted enter the amount you would like 
to wager, and whether you would like the program
to continue running. For program 2, just click within 
the border to add alive cells, and click on alive cells
to remove them. If you would like to enter debug mode, 
press 3 on your keyboard, this will show your inputs 
at the bottom left to the keyboard and the mouse, and
debugger mode will also show whether the grid changes 
when you click at the top left. When you are happy with 
your configuration of the game, enter animation mode or 
manual mode by pressing 1 or 2. Animation mode is 
a continueous mode, where you can simulate the game
at a constant speed. Press 1 or 2 during the animation
to change the speed it goes. During manual mode, you will
need to press a key (any key) to move the generation 
forwards. At anytime, during manual or animation modes, 
press q to exit the program. During the config of the board, 
press 4 to exit.
