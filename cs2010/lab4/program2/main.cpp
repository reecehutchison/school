/*
 RULES FOR THE LAB (personal)
 
 (codeaesthetic on youtube)
 - no more then three levels of nesting --> the big one!!
 - don't write comments, make code readable by using macros (try to write very readable code)
 - focus on naming very good (no abbreviations)
 - a function should be only about the size of one screen / page of paper
